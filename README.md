# Textclassification

text-classification

Trained a Logistic Regression and Recurrent Neural Network (with LSTM layer) methods to carry out classification of Ironic and Sarcastic Tweets using Natural Language Processing. Pre-processing of the text data and word vectorisation was required before training these methods using TensorFlow. Evaluate the methods' performance based on Precision, Recall, and F-Scores.
